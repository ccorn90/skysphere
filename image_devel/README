image_devel: DEPRECATED 1/20/2012 -- do all work in "trunk" branch now.

This folder holds initial work on the video card image capture system.

These elements will eventually be incorportated into the trunk excecutable.

The following are directions for setting up and running the cameras. Files have been moved so this is not entirely accurate yet:

The Sony BRC-300 cameras are currently connected to the computer with S-video cables, and the following code can be used to view the cameras with xawtv:

xawtv -c /dev/video0
or
xawtv -c /dev/video1

for the second camera. You will need to set the options for xawtv to get 
it to work. Video Source will need to be changed to S-Video and Capture 
will need to be changed to grabdisplay. We have also had some trouble 
when trying to use xawtv while ssh'd into the camera control computer. 
It complains that the size of the displays aren't the same. Otherwise, 
it works fine on the control computer.

The current code for taking in images from the cameras can be found in the following directory:

/home/wiebe/atp12-skysphere/image_devel

The folder bin should contain ImageCaptureDriver. A single image can be aquired by inputting the following into the terminal from the image_devel folder:

bin/ImageCaptureDriver
