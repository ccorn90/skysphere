Notes on using videocards / their drivers.

1/6/12:
  The linux command lspci shows all PCI cards installed.  I used it to figure out the 
  manufacturer of the video/audio capture cards:
	>lspci | grep "Capture"
	06:00.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video Capture (rev 11)
	06:00.1 Multimedia controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Audio Capture (rev 11)
	06:02.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video Capture (rev 11)
	06:02.1 Multimedia controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Audio Capture (rev 11)

  Looks like there's one audio and one video device for each capture card.  I'm going to google to 
  see if I can find drivers / information now.
  
  The Bt878 seems to be a chipset that's used on a lot of video cards.  I am pretty confident that
  we can find Linux drivers for this chipset... but there's no way to find out the model number of
  the capture cards unless we go and take a look inside the computer.  Not interested in shutting
  specs down right now, so I'll move along.
