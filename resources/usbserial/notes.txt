Notes on using USB-serial adaptors / their drivers.

  This is looking to be easier than the videocards.  The USB-to-serial adaptors are made by the
  company Keyspan, and their number is USA-19HS.  There's lots of info out there, mostly by Linux
  users being upset that the company doesn't provide drivers for it.  I found some useful resources.

  The USB-to-serial things mount to /dev/ttyUSB* ... and I made a little program called "serialtest"
  which opens the device and tries to write to it.  That program with much thanks to The Internet,
  where I found most of the code examples and ideas.  Make sure that you have permission to the
  /dev/ttyUSB devices.  If you don't, you'll never open the serial port.  I found that the devices
  are owned by root, which is correct, but that I wasn't part of the group that had access to them
  Added my account to the Unix-to-Unix-Copy group (uucp) and that was that.

  As far as drivers, I don't want to try much until we get a new computer to replace the specs
  machine.  Not going to mess too much with something that works.  But...

  A guy who wrote a Debian package with the driver:
    http://www.denis.lemire.name/2007/10/19/ubuntu-keyspan/
    One can download it, but I'm not sure how to install or make it work.

  An Ubuntu error page which makes it sound like modern distros will ship with support for Keyspan
  devices.  That'd be nice... maybe we just need to try installing a modern version of OS.
