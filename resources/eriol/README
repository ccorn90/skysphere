resources/eriol:

The eriol files were provided by Prof. Hall-Holt at the beginning of ATP 2012.
The program eriol is an image viewer for ppm files which includes lots of
functionality and is easily extended for other purposes.  We'll be using this
code as a starting point for some of what we do.

NOTE: eriolObjs.o is the only source of a lot of the object code for eriol.
It is not included in the eriolMane or other cpp files that are available. So
DO NOT DELETE IT!!!

Also, I added a Makefile command to archive eriolObjs to a library and put it in the bin folder.
