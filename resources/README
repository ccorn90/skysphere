resources:

Use this space for libraries, etc, that you don't want to store elsewhere.

Make sure that things work in the *_devel and trunk branches without this dir!

An Important Note About Libraries:
When including a library such as liberiol.a it is IMPERATIVE that you specify the library AFTER the .o
files which reference it.  For example, make sure to put -leriol at the end of the linking statement.
