visca_devel: DEPRECATED 1/20/2012 -- do all work in "trunk" branch now

This folder holds initial work on the visca camera-control system.

The CameraControl class represents a complete camera control system - it interfaces completely 
with the camera via serial port.

These elements will eventually be incorportated into the trunk.
